# EV3-Final-Project
Olivia Roh & Sherry Lu

February 2021

The goal of this EV3 project is to bring four different objects from four different locations to the 'home' area.

# Building the Robot

//Materials//
- LEGO EV3 Robotics package
- Touch sensor
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Gyro sensor
- Color sensor

1. We followed the instructions in the box to create a basic robot consisting of two motorized wheels and a motorized arm.
2. We added the Gyro sensor and Touch sensor at the top of the base, facing upwards.
3. The Ultrasonic sensor is at the front of the robot. It is placed as low as possible to sense objects precisely.
4. The Color sensor is put in between the two wheel motors, placed at an angle.
5. The arm is built strongly to securely move the objects.

# Coding
We coded our EV3 in Python.

To set up our EV3, we followed the steps in [this](https://education.lego.com/en-us/product-resources/mindstorms-ev3/teacher-resources/python-for-ev3) website.

We used Visual Studio Code to do everything.
Our code can be found in this repository.
